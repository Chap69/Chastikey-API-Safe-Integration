Safe's Gmail
	You will need to create a gmail account to be used by the safe. You will need to enable IMAP in Gmail settings. You will also need to allow less secure apps to use this account. Links for details below.

Updates
-------------
Gmail Notifications
- Program now emails both KH and lockee notifications about safe unlocking/locking.
	

Major Features I'm Working on
-------------
1. Safe Restart/Wifi disconnect Notifications
	- Safe will notify KH and lockee if the safe's power or internet has been interrupted. I will try to find a way to the provide amount of time safe it off/disconnected. 

2. Emergency/Remote Interface
	A simple way for a KH to communicate with the safe's computer, using Twitter, in the event Chastikey's server is unreachable.

3. Headless Wi-fi Configuration
	I still need to configure a version of BerryLan to run the R Pi. BerryLan will allow lockee to update safe's wifi network using bluetooth. This also prevents lockee from editing system files. 
	 
4. Mechanism to trigger StatusCheck.py script to run
	StatusCheck.py doesn't need to run often, and scheduling run times seems wasteful. Options: 1.) A tweet sent from either the lockee's or kh's twitter signaling the safe to run the scrip. 2.)A simple physical button to trigger the script to run. 3.) Have the script run on startup. To check, power is cycled to the safe.  


Small Things I'd Like to Add
---------------
- Safe's emails utilizing the real subject line of an email apart from just putting "Subject:" in the body.
